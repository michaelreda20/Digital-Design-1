# Quine McCluskey Solver
## _Boolean Functions Minimizer_

## Introduction

Logic functions is the basis of the field of computer science. To increase its effeciency in terms of time and cost, minimizing these logic functions is a must. There are a lot of tools and algorithms that handle the task of logic functions minimization. Quine McCluskey Algorithm has been one of the most prominent algorithms in minimization of logic functions. In this project, we attempted to implement this algorithm using C++ Programing language.



## Features

- Validation of logic functions.
- Prime implicants generation.
- Essential prime implicants generation.
- Detection of minterms that are not covered by Essential Prime Implicants.
- Able to handle functions consisting of up to 20 logic variables with acceptable speed.
- Able to handle multiple logic functions in a single run.



## Tech

Main technologies used to implement this project:
- [C++] - for creating the project's code.
- [GitHub] - awesome version control system

## Installation
This calculator requires C++ to run. So, make sure to install C++ in your computer.

Download the GitHub Repository found at the link "https://github.com/michaelreda20/Digital-Design-1"
The, store this repo at the location you want in the computer.
Start the exe file to run the program.




## Usage
Before opening the exe file, make sure to have a text file that includes the details of your logic function as follows:
```bash
Number of logic variables
The minterms
The Don't care terms
```
After you open the exe file, it will ask you how much logic functions you want to run in your project.
Then, for each test case enter the path of the file you stored your logic function in.
Finally, the program will display the the prime implicants , the essential prime implicants, and the minterms which are not covered by any essential prime implicant.
